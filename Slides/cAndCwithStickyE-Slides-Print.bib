                   consumption is smooth because permanent income is
                   smoother than measured income. This paper considers
                   the evidence for the contrary position, that
                   permanent income is in fact less smooth than measured
                   income, so that the smoothness of consumption cannot
                   be straightforwardly explained by permanent income
                   theory. The paper argues that in postwar U.S.
                   quarterly data, consumption is smooth because it
                   responds with a lag to changes in income.},
