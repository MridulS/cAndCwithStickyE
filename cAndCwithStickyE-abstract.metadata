    % Since \cite{cdSmooth} macroeconomists have known that aggregate consumption exhibits ``excess smoothness'' compared to benchmark models.  But in microeconomic data for individual households a large literature has found no evidence of such smoothness.  We show that both these facts can be explained by a model in which consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal circumstances but `sticky expectations' about the macroeconomy. In our model, the persistence of aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers' imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility costs because aggregate shocks constitute only a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.  In contrast with models in the existing literature, our model is consistent with both micro and macro stylized facts about consumption dynamics.
   To match evidence about aggregate consumption dynamics, representative agent macroeconomic models require a mechanism to generate `excess smoothness' in consumption.   But a large literature has found no evidence of corresponding smoothness in micro data; consequently, existing microfounded models constructed to match the micro data fail to match the macro smoothness facts.  We show that the micro and macro evidence can be reconciled by a microfounded model in which consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal circumstances but `sticky expectations' about the macroeconomy.  The persistence of aggregate consumption growth in our model reflects consumers' imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility costs because aggregate shocks constitute only a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.% R2 - contribution
