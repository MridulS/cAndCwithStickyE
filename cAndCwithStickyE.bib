                   consumption is smooth because permanent income is
                   smoother than measured income. This paper considers
                   the evidence for the contrary position, that
                   permanent income is in fact less smooth than measured
                   income, so that the smoothness of consumption cannot
                   be straightforwardly explained by permanent income
                   theory. The paper argues that in postwar U.S.
                   quarterly data, consumption is smooth because it
                   responds with a lag to changes in income.},

  abstract =      {This paper presents a model in which price setting
                   firms decide what to pay attention to, subject to a
                   constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic
                   conditions are more variable or more important than
                   aggregate conditions, firms pay more attention to
                   idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate
                   conditions. When we calibrate the model to match the
                   large average absolute size of price changes observed
                   in micro data, prices react fast and by large amounts
                   to idiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small
                   amounts to nominal shocks. Nominal shocks have strong
                   and persistent real effects. (JEL D21, D83, E31,

                   according to which temporary real effects of purely
                   nominal disturbances result from imperfect
                   information, but departs from the assumptions of
                   Lucas (1973) in two crucial respects. Due to
                   monopolistically competitive pricing, higher-order
                   expectations are crucial for aggregate inflation
                   dynamics, as argued by Phelps (1983). And
                   decisionmakers' subjective perceptions of current
                   conditions are assumed to be of imperfect precision,
                   owing to finite information processing capacity, as
                   argued by Sims (2001). The model can explain highly
                   persistent real effects of a monetary disturbance,
                   and a delayed effect on inflation, as found in VAR
                   studies.},

                   aggregate consumption growth (sometimes interpreted
                   as reflecting consumption habits) for thirteen
                   advanced economies. We find that after controlling
                   for measurement error, consumption growth has a high
                   degree of autocorrelation, with a stickiness
                   parameter of about 0.7 on average across countries.
                   The sticky consumption growth model outperforms the
                   random walk model of Hall (1978) and typically fits
                   the data better than the popular Mankiw (1989) model,
                   though in a few countries, the sticky consumption
                   growth and Campbell-Mankiw models work about equally
                   well.},
