Despite generating appropriate aggregate smoothness, when estimated on simulated \emph{individual} data (corresponding to microeconomic evidence), regressions in the spirit of  \cite{dynanHabits} (the seminal paper in the micro `excess smoothness' literature) reproduce her finding that at the level of individual households, consumption growth has little predictability at quarterly frequency---\cite{dynanHabits}'s regressions typically get $\bar{R}^{2}$'s % JS changed to bar R, to be consistent with the discussion of the regression results below
 of about 0.01, and her largest reported value is \hypertarget{dynanR2}{0.02}, figures in the ballpark of those generated in our model.\footnote{\hyperlink{Excess-Sensitivity}{Below} we explain why the \cite{hrsHabit} findings, and our model, are not in substantial conflict with the `excess sensitivity' literature---indeed, our model can explain some puzzles in that literature.}
